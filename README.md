# PW collection bot
The cards are moving under the hood while you are making something great again.

The script can be used both ways: within Tampermonkey add-on or standalone via copy-pasting in browser console.

[Install the script](https://github.com/FairHypo/pw-collection/raw/main/collection.user.js)

The script will ask the necessary questions using alerts and start execution afterwards.

When the target category is collected or the cards have run out, the script will show the statistics of card distribution by category also with an alert.

If the script is broken, or you find a bug - please find me in any way possible and report the problem.

Do the same with all ideas and suggestions for improving the script.

Good luck!
